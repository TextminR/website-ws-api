# What is new?
Today, we have implemented the last must-have user-story. Our API now consists of more than 70000 texts, whereas texts will be added on a monthly basis. This will be done through our Webscraper, which scrapes all kind of different news-papers. Moreover, you can now extract meta data out of any input texts with our API! Try it out yourself: [API](https://api.textminr.tech/docs), endpoint *extract_data*.
