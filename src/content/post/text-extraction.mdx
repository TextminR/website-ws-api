# Text-Extraction

## Why do we need a model to extract meta-data?
One major goal of TextMinR is to create an option with which users are able to analyze their own texts. Thus, a function to let users upload their texts needs to be implemented. Since TextMinr is going to be created for German- and English classes in the first place, we came to the conclusion that it should be possible to upload multiple texts in only one file. Otherwise, users need to upload one file per text, which would not be user-friendly and merely be a waste of time.  To make this work, our app somehow needs to extracts multiple entities out of the texts and binds them to one specific text given in the uploaded file. Suppose there is a Text A which was written by Author A, and a Text B which was written by Author B. Our app now needs to detect both texts and split them up, whereas the detecting part most likely will be done with setting specific rules. Furthermore, it needs to assign Author A/Author B to Text A/Text B and saves it in any kind of data-structure. The result of this process is highly needed because numerous analyze-methods our app works with need these kind of meta-data.

## First Model
We already trained numerous models with different datasets, but none of them were good enough to deploy - till now! Today, we present you our fine tuned multilingual-bert model (accessible through [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/textminr/ner-multilingual-bert) and our [API](https://apies.textminr.tech/docs#/)). Feel free to play around with it! Moreover, we try to optimize this fine tuned model even more.
